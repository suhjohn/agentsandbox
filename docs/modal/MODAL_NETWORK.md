# Networking and security

Sandboxes are built to be secure-by-default, meaning that a default Sandbox has
no ability to accept incoming network connections or access your Modal resources.

## Networking

Since Sandboxes may run untrusted code, they have options to restrict their network access.
To block all network access, set `block_network=True` on [`Sandbox.create`](/docs/reference/modal.Sandbox#create).

For more fine-grained networking control, a Sandbox's outbound network access
can be restricted using the `cidr_allowlist` parameter. This parameter takes a
list of CIDR ranges that the Sandbox is allowed to access, blocking all other
outbound traffic.

### Connecting to Sandboxes with HTTP and WebSockets

You can make authenticated HTTP and WebSocket requests to a Sandbox by generating
Sandbox Connect Tokens. They work like this:

```python notest
# Start a Sandbox with a server running on port 8080.
sb = modal.Sandbox.create(
    "bash", "-c", "python3 -m http.server 8080",
    app=my_app,
)

# Create a connect token, optionally including arbitrary user metadata.
creds = sb.create_connect_token(user_metadata={"user_id": "foo"})

# Make an HTTP request, passing the token in the Authorization header.
requests.get(creds.url, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {creds.token}"})

# You can also put the token in a `_modal_connect_token` query param.
url = f"{creds.url}/?_modal_connect_token={creds.token}"
ws_url = url.replace("https://", "wss://")
with websockets.connect(ws_url) as socket:
    socket.send("Hello world!")
```

The server running on port 8080 in the container will receive an authenticated
request with an unspoofable `X-Verified-User-Data` header whose value is the
JSON-serialized Python dict that was passed as `user_metadata` to the
`create_connect_token()` function. This can be used by the application to
determine access control, for example.

There are a few things to remember with Sandbox Connect Tokens:

1. The server inside the container must be listening on port 8080.
2. The token may be sent in an `Authorization` header, in a `_modal_connect_token`
   query param, or in a `_modal_connect_token` cookie.
3. If `_modal_connect_token` is set as a query param, the resulting response will
   include a `Set-Cookie` header that sets it as a cookie.
4. The `user_metadata` must be JSON-serializable and must be less than 512
   characters after serialization.

### Forwarding ports

While it is recommended to use [Sandbox Connect Tokens](#connecting-to-sandboxes-with-http-and-websockets)
for HTTP requests and WebSocket connections to the container, you can also expose
raw TCP ports to the internet. This is useful if, for example, you want to run a
server inside the Sandbox that expects a raw TCP connection and handles
authentication itself.

Use the `encrypted_ports` and `unencrypted_ports` parameters of `Sandbox.create`
to specify which ports to forward. You can then access the public URL of a tunnel
using the [`Sandbox.tunnels`](/docs/reference/modal.Sandbox#tunnels) method:

```python notest
import requests
import time

sb = modal.Sandbox.create(
    "python",
    "-m",
    "http.server",
    "12345",
    encrypted_ports=[12345],
    app=my_app,
)

tunnel = sb.tunnels()[12345]

time.sleep(1)  # Wait for server to start.

print(f"Connecting to {tunnel.url}...")
print(requests.get(tunnel.url, timeout=5).text)
```

It is also possible to create an encrypted port that uses `HTTP/2` rather than `HTTP/1.1` with the `h2_ports` option. This will return
a URL that you can make H2 (HTTP/2 + TLS) requests to. If you want to run an `HTTP/2` server inside a sandbox, this feature may be useful.
Here is an example:

```python notest
import time

port = 4359
sb = modal.Sandbox.create(
    app=my_app,
    image=my_image,
    h2_ports = [port],
)
p = sb.exec("python", "my_http2_server.py")

tunnel = sb.tunnels()[port]
time.sleep(1)
print(f"Tunnel URL: {tunnel.url}")
```

For more details on how tunnels work, see the [tunnels guide](/docs/guide/tunnels).

## Security model

Sandboxes are built on top of [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/), a container runtime
by Google that provides strong isolation properties. gVisor has custom logic to
prevent Sandboxes from making malicious system calls, giving you stronger isolation
than standard [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) containers.

Additionally, Sandboxes are not authorized to access other resources in your Modal
workspace the way that Modal Functions are [by default](/docs/guide/restricted-access).
As a result, the blast radius of any malicious code will be limited to the Sandbox
container itself.
